# Borg Backup Server

> **Early Beta (v0.8)** — This software is under active development and likely contains bugs. It is not recommended for production workloads. Use at your own risk.

A self-hosted web application for centrally managing [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/) across multiple Linux and macOS endpoints. A lightweight agent polls the server for tasks over HTTPS, backs up over SSH to the server, and reports progress back. No inbound connections to endpoints required — works behind firewalls and NAT. Includes a setup wizard for zero-config installation.

---

## Features

- **Agent-based architecture** — endpoints initiate all connections; no inbound ports needed on clients
- **SSH with append-only security** — agents back up over SSH but cannot delete existing archives
- **Setup wizard** — browser-based installer configures database, admin account, and storage in minutes
- **Real-time progress** — live progress bars during backups
- **File-level restore** — browse archive contents in a collapsible tree, restore individual files or entire directories
- **Download archives** — extract and download files as .tar.gz directly from the browser
- **Flexible scheduling** — 10min to monthly intervals, multiple times per day, manual trigger
- **Backup templates** — pre-configured directory sets for common server roles (web, database, mail, etc.)
- **Retention policies** — per-plan prune settings (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **Multi-user** — role-based access (admin sees all, users see own clients)
- **Queue management** — concurrent job limits, cancel/retry, priority ordering
- **Encrypted passphrases** — repository passwords encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- **Email alerts** — SMTP notifications on backup failure
- **Dashboard** — backup charts, server stats, active jobs, log feed with 15s auto-refresh

## Quick Start

### Server

Start with a fresh **Ubuntu 22.04+** server with OpenSSH server installed. The server needs enough disk space for the MySQL database plus a directory or partition dedicated to backup repository data (this can be a separate mount like `/mnt/backups`).

Run the automated installer:

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpope/borgbackupserver/main/bin/bbs-install
sudo bash bbs-install --hostname backups.example.com
```

For **LAN-only installations** without SSL (internal IP, `.local` hostname, or no public DNS):

```bash
sudo bash bbs-install --hostname 192.168.1.100 --no-ssl
```

The installer handles everything — packages, Apache, MySQL, SSL certificate, and cron. When it finishes, open the URL it prints and the **setup wizard** will walk you through database connection, admin account, and storage configuration.

See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for manual setup or full details.

### Agent

From the BBS web UI, create a client, then run the install command on your endpoint:

```bash
curl -s https://your-server/get-agent | sudo bash -s -- \
    --server https://your-server --key YOUR_API_KEY
```

See [docs/AGENT.md](docs/AGENT.md) for manual install and configuration.

## Architecture

```
Endpoint                                 BBS Server
  [bbs-agent.py]                         [PHP + MySQL + borg]

       |--- register (hostname, OS) --------> |  HTTPS
       |--- download SSH key ---------------> |  HTTPS
       |                                      |

       |                                      |
       |  [borg create over SSH] -----------> |  SSH (borg serve --append-only)
       |                                      |
       |--- progress (files, bytes) --------> |  HTTPS (every 5s)
       |--- status (completed/failed) ------> |  HTTPS
       |--- file catalog (batch) -----------> |  HTTPS
       |                                      |
       |            [server runs borg prune]  |  local (server-side)
       |                                      |
       |--- poll for tasks -----------------> |  (next cycle)
```

- **HTTPS** for control plane (task polling, progress, status)
- **SSH** for data plane (borg backup/restore via `borg serve`)
- **Append-only** — agents cannot delete existing archives; pruning runs server-side
